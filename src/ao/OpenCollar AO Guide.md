# Guide for the OpenCollar Sub AO HUD Animation Overrider + Collar Interface

[Texture: OpenCollar SubAO Help Image]

## Collar Integration

To have the AO intergrated with OpenCollar work you need an OpenCollar Version 3.3 or higher.
Collar Integration allows the primary owner to lock the ao and uses the collar to authorize commands. The AO automaticly detects the collar.

Note: with older collars the owners still can acess the OpenCollar Sub AO menu

## How To Use

Right-click the OpenCollar Sub AO in your inventory and select `Wear`. It should attach itself to some point on your HUD (default is bottom right)

The 4 HUD Buttons: (Top to bottom when at default setting)

1. Main Menu - (square menu sheet) Opens up the SUB AOs menu. (* See Below)
2. Sit Anywhere - Allows you to sit anywhere. White means on, gray means off.
3. The 'Power' button - Turns OpenCollar Sub AO on and off. White means on, gray means off. When OpenCollar Sub AO is off, it won't override your animations
4. Dock/Hide - (nadu girl) Docks/hides the three buttons. Pressing it again will undock/show the buttons.
    * If the user has collar integration enabled, a menu to select the AO Menu, Collar Menu, Couples Animations, and HUD Options pops up. If collar integration is off the menu will default to the standard AO Menu.

## Setup Instructions

This section tells you how to add/change animations.

* If you are wearing the OpenCollar Sub AO, detach it.
* Find the OpenCollar Sub AO in your inventory. If you have multiple OpenCollar Sub AOs, find the right one that you want to edit.
* Make sure you're on land where you can rez objects, and the auto return is several minutes long. If you're not sure, go to a sandbox.
* Press Ctrl-3 to bring up the edit window.
* Drag the OpenCollar Sub AO onto the ground. It should be highlighted for edit.
* On the Edit window, click the 'More' button, then the 'Content' tab. You are now viewing the content's of the OpenCollar Sub AO's inventory. If you have a lot of animations in the OpenCollar Sub AO's inventory, wait a while for this window to finish refreshing.
* Drag the animation(s) you want to add, from your own inventory, into the OpenCollar Sub AO's inventory. Wait for the to animations show up in the OpenCollar Sub AO's inventory. If you take the OpenCollar Sub AO back into your inventory too soon, you may lose animations due to SL inventory issues.
* Find the notecard for the set you want to edit, and drag it from the OpenCollar Sub AO's inventory into your inventory.
* In your inventory, rename this notecard. Call it "My Anims" or something like that. Keep the name small, it needs to fit on a dialog menu button.
* Open up the notecard. You'll see lines in it that look like the following:

```text
[ Walking ]
[ Sitting ]
```

... and so on. If the notecard was already set up with animations, the lines will look like this:

```text
[ Walking ]MaleWalk1|MaleWalk2|DorkyWalk1
[ Sitting ]CrossLeggedSit|MaleSit1
```

* Find the line that corresponds to the animation you want to add. For example, let's say you're trying to add a new 'Sitting' animation. Find the line that starts with [ Sitting ]
* If the line doesn't have any animations in it, then at the end of the line, type the animation name. If the line already has some animation(s) in it, then at the end of this line, type the | character, and then type/paste the name of your animation. Make sure you don't add any spaces around the animation names. Look at the other lines in the notecard to see what it should look like. Make sure you spell the animation name right. Make sure you have the capitalization right. A good way to do this is to copy the animation's name by right-clicking on it and selecting 'Properties'. Once you are done, it should look like this:

```text
[ Sitting ]CrossLeggedSit|MaleSit1|NewAnimationYouAdded
```

* Repeat the previous step for all the animations you want to add. You can repeat lines if you need to. For example, if you want to add a large number of walks, you can split them up across multiple lines like this:

```text
[ Walking ]MaleWalk1|MaleWalk2|MaleWalk3
[ Walking ]MaleWalk4|MaleWalk5|MaleWalk6
```

Make sure that both lines start with `[ Walking ]`, and the script will combine the specified animations.

* Save this notecard.
* Drag the notecard you just created/saved from your inventory into the OpenCollar Sub AO's inventory.
* Take the OpenCollar Sub AO back into your inventory.
* Wear the OpenCollar Sub AO.
* Click the Menu button on the OpenCollar Sub AO.
* Click the 'Load' button in the dialog menu.
* Click the button that has the name of your new notecard in it.
* Wait for the OpenCollar Sub AO to tell you that it's finished loading the new notecard.
* Your new animations should now be activated. If you added a new walk/sit/ground sit (for example, you added a 3rd walk), you need to select that number on the corresponding menu (click on Walks, then select the 3rd walk).
